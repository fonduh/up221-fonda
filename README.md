This is Fonda Hu's repository for UP221 - Introduction to GIS and Spatial Data Science

### ðŸ‘‹ intro 
Hi! My name is Fonda. I'm a third-year @ UCLA majoring in math/econ major with an urban and regional studies minor. 
After completing undergrad, I want to pursue a graduate degree in urban planning - if you have any insight or advice to share, I'd love to chat! ðŸ¥³
